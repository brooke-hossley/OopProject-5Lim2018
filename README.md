## Description
This program simulates the fun family board game Ticket to ride.
Challenge your friend to a game that ends all friendships, especially if they were your group members.
Collect train cards to claim routes and cut people off in destination tickets to the point where your parents kick you out of the house for being an asshole.
Complete destination tickets to create a monopoly over the entire board like communist Russia. Nothing like the peaceful rise of Germany in the 1930's.
In the end, determine which of your closest friends you will ask to play this game that you've put way too many hours into in. 
## Operation Instructions
